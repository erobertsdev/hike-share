# Hike Share

An app geared toward sharing pictures and some information about hikes.

## Notes

Front-end is HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.

Back-end utilizes Firebase for authentication, database and storage.

Please note that although it's a fully functioning site, this is not intended to be a production app.  I simply built this as a portfolio project/learning opportunity.  There's going to be bugs and I'm still working to hammer out some dents.
